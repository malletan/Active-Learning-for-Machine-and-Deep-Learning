# Active-Learning-for-Machine-and-Deep-Learning
A from scratch implementation of pool based methods. Hands on modAL

There are 2 parts to these works.

- Some introductory scripts to active learning problems, with some of them being "from-scratch" implementation (using sklearn for models to train), some of them using the modAL library.
- A more challenging implementation. We're trying to use active learning techniques to efficiently classify images that are originating from different post-acquisition processing pipelines.
